# Smart-Brain APP

Smart-Brain-2.0 is a dockerized web page that detects multiple faces in images using Clarifai API, it uses JWT to manages sessions, and redis in the Smart-Brain-API-2.0 to handle sign-in/sign-out as well as updating profile information. As a fun add-in AWS Lambda was utilized to add badge tokens based on user activity.

To view the live first version vist: https://smart-brain-kevinlc33.herokuapp.com/

Due to this being dockerized I have not put this version on-line as it was built to simulate developing in a team-enviornment for getting new developers started quickly.
